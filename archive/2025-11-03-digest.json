A notable issue with LLMs is \"hallucination,\" where the model generates plausible but incorrect or nonsensical information. The mechanism of \"attention\" within these models is crucial for enhancing their ability to process and prioritize relevant information, significantly impacting their overall performance. Prompt engineering has emerged as a vital technique to steer LLM outputs more effectively, enabling more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. Furthermore, OpenAI's recent strategic changes signify a significant shift in the AI landscape, potentially reshaping how LLM technologies are developed and applied across industries.\n\n### 🎨 Digital Art: Pointillism & Motion Design\n\n*Inspired by today's AI news trends*\n\n![Digital Pointillism Artwork](image/ai_news/2025-11-03-pointillism.png)\n",
