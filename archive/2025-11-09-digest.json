The AI stack, which includes LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AI hardware, plays a foundational role in the development and execution of AI systems. There's a growing belief that LLMs could be pivotal in achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), due to their ability to process and understand vast amounts of information. However, the complexity of deploying LLMs stems from their intricate architecture and the extensive resources they require. Furthermore, LLMs contribute to the progress towards AGI by enhancing machine understanding and interaction capabilities, showcasing their integral role in pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve.\n",
